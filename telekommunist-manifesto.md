<h3> Generelles </h3>
<hr>
Das Telekommunisten Manifest, erschienen am 28.02.2010, beschreibt eine Weg zu einer neuen Produktionsform, die zunächst kapitalistische Mechanismen kapert und ultimativ den Kapitalismus überwinden will. 
<p> Wegen der stark an kommunistisches Material angelehnten Argumentationslinie, ist diese vermutlich nicht direkt für unsere Zwecke und Zielgruppe übertragbar, zumindest eine Umformung wäre nötig. Dieses Manifest köntne eine Referenz für Sprache und Struktur unseres Texts sein.

<h3> Zitate </h3>
<hr>
"In order to change society we must actively expand the scope of our commons, so that our independent
communities of peers can be materially sustained and can resist the encroachments of Capitalism.
Whatever portion of our productivity we allow to be taken from us, will return in the form of our own
oppression" (S. 3)
<p>"Property is by it's nature antagonistic to freedom. Property is the ability to control productive assets at a
distance, the ability to "own" something being put to productive use by another person." (S. 10)
<p>"Rent, in economic terms,
is the income earned for allowing others to use property, ultimately, this income is derived by claiming a
portion of what they produce as your own. "(S. 10)
<p>"Capitalism, rooted in the idea of earning income by way of idle share ownership, requires centralized control
without which producers have no reason to share their income with outside shareholders. "(S. 15)
<p>"[Developing] Internet resources requires the application of wealth, and so
long as the source of this wealth is finance capital, the great peer-to-peer potential of the Internet will
remain unrealized. In order to develop alternative ways of producing and sharing we need an alternative to
venture capital and it's logic of capture and exploitation."(S. 15)
<p>"If we want to have a say in the way copyright works (or to abolish it) or to
influence the way communication networks are operated, or if we want to make any social reforms
whatsoever, we must start by preventing property owners from turning our productivity into their
accumulated wealth."(S. 16)
<p>"Employing a Venture Commune to share
material property hijacks the apparatus that exists to enforce privilege to instead protect a common stock,
available for use by independent producers"(S. 18)
<p>"Any change that can produce a more equitable society is dependent on a prior change in the mode of
production which increases the share of wealth retained by the worker. "(S.19)
<p>"As David Ricardo said about
landlords, the interest of a software company like Microsoft is always opposed to the interest of every
software user. The organizations that use software, namely schools, factories, offices, and e-commerce
enterprises, collectively employ far more software developers than the few companies who sell proprietary
software, such as Microsoft. Thus, free software is very attractive to them as it allows them to reduce their
individual development costs by collectively maintaining a common stock of software assets."(S. 26)
<p>"While a corporation can employ code from these projects in proprietary
applications, it does so at a cost, by separating their development from the main free software project, they
have to manually patch or reimpliment code improvements from the free distribution into their own fork and
forgo help from the free software community in improving their own proprietary contributions. Meaning that
companies that chose to make proprietary versions of free software need a strong business reason to do so,
in practice this rarely happens as proprietary versions tend to quickly fall behind the free software versions
in functionality and thereby lose their market value"(S. 27)
